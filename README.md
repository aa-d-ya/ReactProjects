# ReactProjects

Welcome to my GitHub repository for React projects! This repository serves as a collection of my React projects as I continue to learn and grow as a React developer.

## About

As a beginner in React, I'm using this repository to showcase my progress and the various projects I'll built while learning React. Each project is contained in its own folder, with its own README and code.

## Projects

Here's a list of the React projects available in this repository:

1. purple-kicks - My very first react project. Just a simple landling page.
